Textbook:
*Interactive Computer Graphics: A Top-Down Approach With Shader-Based Opengl*

"Computer animation and graphics–once rare, complicated, and comparatively expensive–are now prevalent in everyday life from the computer screen to the movie screen. Interactive Computer Graphics: A Top-Down Approach with Shader-Based OpenGL, 6e, is the only introduction to computer graphics text for undergraduates that fully integrates OpenGL 3.1 and emphasizes application-based programming. Using C and C++, the top-down, programming-oriented approach allows for coverage of engaging 3D material early in the text so readers immediately begin to create their own 3D graphics. "
 
  
   
-This repo is for all of my old C++ computer graphics projects. I used a Linux computer and the textbook listed above.
